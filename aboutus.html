      <h1>About Us</h1>
  
      <h2>Welcome to Kota Joint</h2>
      <p>
        Born in the heart of Soweto, <strong>Kota Joint</strong> is more than just a local food stop — it's a celebration of South African street culture, flavor, and community spirit. Our name is inspired by the iconic <strong>kota</strong>, a beloved township delicacy made from a hollowed-out quarter loaf of bread stuffed with everything from crispy fries and fried eggs to polony, cheese, and our signature chutney. It’s bold, hearty, and unmistakably Mzansi.
      </p>
  
      <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
      <p>
        At Kota Joint, our mission is simple: <em>to serve authentic, delicious South African food at affordable prices — while building a future for our community.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We&apos;re proud to offer more than just meals. Each of our local stores is a platform for youth empowerment. We create opportunities for young, unemployed members of our community to gain valuable skills, build confidence, and explore the path of entrepreneurship through meaningful work in our kitchens.
      </p>
  
      <h2>A Taste of Home</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're grabbing a quick bite or sharing a kota with friends, you're not just getting great food — you're supporting local dreams, one meal at a time. At Kota Joint, we serve more than just street food — we serve stories, memories, and the soul of Soweto on every plate.
